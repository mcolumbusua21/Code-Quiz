When I am taking a code quiz and I click the start button, 
a timer starts and I am presented with a question.
When I answer a question then I am presented with another question. 
If I answer a question incorrectly ,then time is subtracted from the clock.When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
then the game is over. When the game is over ,then I can save my initials and my score.
